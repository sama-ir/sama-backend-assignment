# Assignment: Sama Django Backend Assignment Project

## Objective:

-   The purpose of this assignment is to assess your proficiency in
    various aspects of Django/Python Backend development. You will be
    working on a payment system, specifically focusing on model/database
    design, Django and DRF efficiency, design patterns and SOLID
    principles, overall code quality, and Git usage efficiency.

## Scenario:

-   You are tasked with developing a simplified payment system for a
    financial application. The system should allow users to perform
    basic operations such as creating wallets, transferring funds
    between wallets, and viewing transaction history.
-   The project does not need to have any authentication. Use sqlite as
    the database. Try to write at least 3 tests that showcases your
    understanding of a test framework and testing in general.

## Requirements:

### Model/Database Design:

-   Design Django models for User, Wallet, and Transaction.
-   A User should be able to have multiple wallets.
-   Ensure that the database design supports scalability.
-   Implement appropriate database indexes and relationships.

### Django and DRF Efficiency:

-   Create Django Rest Framework (DRF) views and serializers for wallet
    creation, fund transfer, and getting transaction history.
-   Implement efficient querysets to retrieve data without unnecessary
    overhead.
-   Utilize Django Rest Framework (DRF) to expose API endpoints for the
    required operations.
-   Ensure atomic transactions for fund transfers to maintain data
    consistency.

### Design Patterns and Overall code quality:

-   Write clean and well-structured code following python best practices
    and Implement design patterns where applicable.
-   Apply SOLID principles to enhance code maintainability and
    extensibility.
-   Write clear and concise comments/documentation for your code
    whenever necessary, but avoid too much comments.
-   Implement error handling for potential edge cases and provide
    informative error messages.
-   Include appropriate comments to explain complex logic or design
    decisions.

### Git Usage Efficiency:

-   Use Git for version control throughout the development process.
-   Make regular commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
-   Provide a concise README file with instructions on how to set up and
    run the project locally.

## Submission:

-   Share a link to your Git repository containing the project.
-   Include a brief README.md with setup instructions and any additional
    information you deem necessary.

## Note:

-   The assignment is expected to take not more than a day to complete
    (hopefully less than that), If it takes more time or you are facing
    issues, feel free to contact us to discus the matter.
-   Focus on demonstrating your proficiency in Django/Python Backend
    development, efficient database design, code quality, design
    patterns, SOLID principles, tests, and Git usage.
-   Feel free to make assumptions where necessary and document them in
    your code or README.

## Evaluation Criteria:

-   The code will be evaluated based on the completeness of the
    implementation, adherence to best practices, code quality, and the
    efficiency of the solution in meeting the specified requirements.
